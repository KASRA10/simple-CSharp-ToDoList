## Introduction
Welcome to the Simple C# ToDo List project. This application was developed as a basic and practical exercise in building desktop applications using Windows Forms in C#. Its primary purpose is to help beginners learn how to use the `ListView` control and understand core functionalities like adding, removing, marking tasks as done or not done, and clearing the list.

## About
This project is a straightforward implementation of a To Do List that leverages the ListView control. It features a text box for entering new tasks and buttons to manage them (add, remove, done, not done, clear). The design is intentionally simple to help you grasp the fundamentals of Windows Forms and event-driven programming in C#.

## What is Windows Forms?
Windows Forms is a graphical user interface (GUI) class library within the .NET Framework, used for developing rich and interactive desktop applications for the Windows platform. It offers a collection of customizable controls—such as buttons, text boxes, labels, and ListView—that streamline the process of building user-friendly applications.

## What is a .md File for Documentation?
A `.md` file is a Markdown file used for creating formatted text using a plain text syntax. Markdown allows you to write documentation that is both easy to read in its raw form and simple to convert into HTML. This makes it an ideal choice for project documentation on platforms like GitHub.

## How This Program Works
- **Text Box Input:** Type your new task into the provided text box.
- **Add Button:** Click to add the new task to the ListView.
- **Remove Button:** Select a task and remove it from the ListView.
- **Done / Not Done Buttons:** Toggle the status of a task to mark it as completed or still pending.
- **Clear Button:** Use this to clear all tasks from the ListView.
